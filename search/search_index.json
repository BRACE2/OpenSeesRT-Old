The compressive stress-strain envelope, up to the peak compressive strength(unconfined or confined) is based on the Fujii concrete model (Hoshikuma et al. 1997). The material has two options regarding the strength degradation in tension: (a) tri-linear or (b) nonlinear [based on the tension stiffening relation of Stevens et al (1991)]. The softening behavior in compression is tri-linear. \u2003\u2003The model accounts for the effect of normal tensile strains on the concrete compressive behavior when used with the Truss2 or CorotTruss2 elements. See the Truss2 Element for description of how the normal strain is computed. The instantaneous stress is &beta; * f where f is the computed stress and &beta; is the compressive stress reduction factor which depends on the normal tensile strain, &epsilon;<sub>n</sub>. The relation between &epsilon;<sub>n</sub> and &beta; (see the Biaxial Behavior Section ) is tri-linear. Default values result in &beta; = 1. See the Examples Section for the use of this material model in truss models for planar RC walls and a beam-truss model for a non-planar wall loaded biaxially. thumb|upright=2.0|alt=RC C-shaped wall |Reinforced concrete wall with a C-shaped section subject to multi-axial loading, described in the examples . uniaxialMaterial ConcretewBeta $matTag $fpc $ec0 $fcint $ecint $fcres $ecres $ft $ftint $etint $ftres $etres < -lambda $lambda > < -alpha $alpha &gt; &lt;-beta $bint $ebint $bres $ebres > < -M $M > < -E $Ec > < -conf $fcc $ecc > matTag integer tag identifying material fpc peak unconfined concrete compressive strength* ec0 compressive strain corresponding to unconfined concrete compressive strength* fcint, ecint intermediate stress-strain point for compression post-peak envelope* fcres, ecres residual stress-strain point for compression post-peak envelope* ftint tensile strength of concrete ftint, etint intermediate stress-strain point for tension softening envelope ftres, etres residual stress-strain point for tension softening envelope Optional: lambda controls the path of unloading from compression strain (default 0.5) alpha controls the path of unloading from tensile strain (default 1) bint ebint intermediate \u03b2-strain point for for biaxial effect (default 1 and 0, respectively) bres ebres residual \u03b2-strain point for for biaxial effect (default 1 and 0, respectively) M factor for Stevens et al.

For non-zero M , the tension stiffening behavior will govern the post-peak tension envelope. Tri-linear tension softening parameters ftint, etint, ftres, etres will have no effect, but dummy values must be specified. Value of Ec must be between fpc / ec0 and 2* fpc / ec0 otherwise the closest value will be assigned. Implementation thumb|upright=2.5|Equation 1. thumb|upright=1.8|Equation 2. thumb|upright=1.8|Equation 3. Uniaxial Behavior \u2003\u2003Figure 1 shows the compression and tension envelopes and the input parameters. The confined concrete envelope is defined by Equation 1 up to strain ecc . The default values of fcc and ecc are equal to fpc and ec0 , respectively, for an an unconfined behavior. Following this region, the compression envelope is tri-linear and passes through the points ( ecint , fcint ) and ( ecres , fcres ) in that order. For compression strains larger than ecres , the residual stress is fcres . \u2003\u2003For compression strain, the slope of the unloading branch is defined by Equation 2. After reaching zero stress, the material reloads linearly to the point with the largest tensile strain that occurred before. \u2003\u2003The tension envelope is linear until it reaches ft . If the tension stiffening parameter M is not specified, the tension envelope after reaching ft is tri-linear and passes through the points ( etint , ftint ) and ( etres , ftres ) in that order. For tensile strains larger than etres , the residual stress is fcres . \u2003\u2003If M is specified, the nonlinear tension stiffening behavior defined by Equation 3. It is suggested that M = (75 mm)* &rho;<sub>l</sub> / d<sub>b</sub> where &rho;<sub>l</sub> is the steel ratio in the direction parallel to the material direction and d b is the bar diameter in mm. \u2003\u2003The material unloads from tension strain using a slope of Ec . After reaching zero stress, the material targets the point (0, - alpha ft ). Thereafter, the material loads linearly to the point where the peak compressive strain previously occurred. In the case where the slope leading to this target point is less than that for the point (0, - alpha ft ), the material reloads directly to the point where peak compressive strain occurred. thumb|center|upright=4.0|alt=ConcretewBeta Figure 1 |Figure 1.

Relation between the concrete compressive stress reduction factor, \\(\\beta\\) , and normal tensile strain, \\(\\epsilon_n\\) Biaxial Behavior \u2003\u2003The ConcretewBeta material model accounts for the biaxial strain field on the concrete compressive behavior when used in conjunction with the Truss2 element. The Truss2 element computes the strain normal to the direction of the element (see Truss2 Element ). \u2003\u2003Figure 2 shows the relationship between concrete compressive stress reduction factor, &beta; , and the normal tensile strain, &epsilon;<sub>n</sub>. For compressive stresses, the instantaneous stress value computed by the material is \\(\\beta f_c\\) where \\(f_c\\) is the compressive stress given by the uniaxial behavior described above. For positive (tensile) stress, \\(\\beta = 1\\) . For compressive stress, the \\(\\beta - \\epsilon_n\\) relationship is tri-linear and passes through the points (0,1), ( ebint , bint ), and ( ebres , bres ) in that order. For normal tensile strains larger than ebres , &beta; = bres .
