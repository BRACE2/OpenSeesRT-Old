# LoadPath 

```cpp
#include <analysis/integrator/LoadPath.h>
```

`LoadPath` is a subclass of `StaticIntegrator`, it is used to when
performing a static analysis on the `FE_Model` using a user specified load
path. The load path is specified in a Vector, `path`, to the objects
constructor and at each step in the analysis:

$$
\lambda_n^{(i)} - \lambda_{n-1} = \texttt{path}[n] - \texttt{path}[n-1]
$$

Knowing $\lambda_n^{(i)} = path(n)$ prior to each iteration, the $N+1$
unknowns in equationÂ [staticFormTaylor](#staticFormTaylor), is reduced 
to $N$ unknowns and results in the following equation:

$$\boldsymbol{r}(\boldsymbol{u}_{n}) = \lambda_n^{(i)} \boldsymbol{p}_f 
 - \boldsymbol{p}_{\sigma}\left(\boldsymbol{u}_{n}^{(i)} \right) - 
\boldsymbol{K}_n^{(i)} 
(\boldsymbol{u}_{n} - \boldsymbol{u}_{n}^{(i)})  
\label{staticFormLoadPath}$$



## Methods

A vector object
`path` is created which is a copy of `loadPath` and an index into this
vector is set to $0$.

The integer `INTEGRATOR_TAGS_LoadPath` (defined in  `<classTags.h>`) is
passed to the StaticIntegrator classes constructor. No vector object is
created. Provided for the FEM_ObjectBroker to create a blank object,
`recvSelf()` should be invoked on this object.

\
Invokes the destructor on the vector `path`.

\
The object obtains the current value of $\lambda$ from the `path` vector
using the current index. The index is then incremented by $1$. If the
index is greater than the size of `path`, $\lambda$ is set to $0$ and an
error message is printed. It will then invoke *applyLoadDomain(0.0,
$\lambda$)* on the AnalysisModel object. Returns $0$ if successful. A
warning message is printed and a $-1$ is returned if no AnalysisModel is
associated with the object.

```{.cpp}
int update(const Vector &$\Delta U$);
```

Invoked this causes the object to first increment the DOF_Group
displacements with $\Delta U$, by invoking *incrDisp($\Delta U)$* on the
AnalysisModel, and then to update the domain, by invoking
`updateDomain()` on the AnalysisModel. Returns $0$ if successful, a
warning message and a $-1$ is returned if no AnalysisModel is associated
with the object.

```{.cpp}
int Print(OPS_Stream &s, int flag = 0);
```

The object sends to $s$ its type, the current value of $\lambda$.
