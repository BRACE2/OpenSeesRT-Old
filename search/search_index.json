This material is a refined version of the classic nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening material model based on the Voce isotropic hardening law and the Chaboche kinematic hardening law. The UVC model contains an updated isotropic hardening law, with parameter constraints, to simulate the permanent decrease in yield stress with initial plastic loading associated with the discontinuous yielding phenomenon in mild steels. Details regarding the model, its implementation, and calibration can be found in the references cited at the end. The multiaxial (e.g., for solid/brick elements) and plane-stress (e.g., for quad/plate/shell elements) versions are also available. The multiaxial and plane-stress implementations have the exact same hardening rules as this uniaxial model, and only differ in their purpose and numerical implementation.

Validation with Abaqus: This first example compares the response of the UVC model with the built-in nonlinear isotropic/kinematic material model in Abaqus v6.14. For this validation the model updates are neglected by simply setting DInf = 0.0 and a = 1.0. The model parameters are: E = 179800 MPa, fy = 318.5 MPa, QInf = 100.7 MPa, b = 8.0, DInf = 0.0 MPa, a = 1.0, C1 = 11608.2 MPa, gamma1 = 145.2, C2 = 1026.3 MPa, gamma2 = 4.7 Figure 1 shows that the UVC implementation in OpenSees agrees with the built-in Abaqus model to the level of machine precision. Therefore, you can use the UVC model in place of the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening material model provided in Abaqus and many other finite element simulation platforms. The finite element models used to validate the Abaqus and OpenSees responses can be found at https://github.com/ahartloper/UVC_MatMod . Figure 1. Validation of UVC model with built-in nonlinear isotropic/kinematic material in Abaqus. 2. Comparison with structural steels: The applicability of the UVC material model for structural steels is demonstrated through two comparisons with experimental data from uniaxial coupon tests. A comparison with a North American steel, A992 Gr. 50 (nominal fy = 345 MPa), is shown in Figure 2. A comparison with a European steel, S355J2+N (nominal fy = 355 MPa), is shown in Figure 3. In both cases the UVC model is able to represent well the initial yield stress as well as the material behavior in later loading cycles. The parameters used for the A992 Gr. 50 and S355J2+N steels, along with other common structural steels, are provided and discussed in the next section. File:A992_flange_UVC.png | Figure 2.

Comparison of UVC model with uniaxial coupon test data from the S355J2+N 25 mm plate data set. UVC model parameters for structural steels Below is a list of UVC model parameters for twelve structural steels from Reference [1] using two backstresses. These parameters are applicable for all implementations of the UVC model (uniaxial, plane-stress, multiaxial). References [1,3] contain detailed information on the calibration procedure used to obtain the model parameters. All of the parameters provided in the table below were obtained by minimizing the total squared-strain energy across at least five uniaxial coupon tests of distinct strain histories subject to the constraint that the material response is non-softening. Therefore, the UVC material model parameters should be representative of steel material behavior for arbitrarily imposed strains. Note that although the parameters in this table are considered representative of a specific sample of each material, significant variations can exist between different samples of the same material. All the parameters in the table are obtained through the UVC model calibration procedure implemented in the open-source Python package RESSPyLab . The RESSPyLab package can be used to generate UVC model parameters for other steel materials if the data is available. Details and examples on the calibration are provided on the RESSPyLab web page. Note that the parameters provided in the table below were calibrated using the true stress-strain definition, i.e., e_true = ln(1+(L-L_0)/L_0) and s_true = F/A_0 * (1 + (L-L_0)/L_0).

The compressive stress-strain envelope, up to the peak compressive strength(unconfined or confined) is based on the Fujii concrete model (Hoshikuma et al. 1997). The material has two options regarding the strength degradation in tension: (a) tri-linear or (b) nonlinear [based on the tension stiffening relation of Stevens et al (1991)]. The softening behavior in compression is tri-linear. \u2003\u2003The model accounts for the effect of normal tensile strains on the concrete compressive behavior when used with the Truss2 or CorotTruss2 elements. See the Truss2 Element for description of how the normal strain is computed. The instantaneous stress is &beta; * f where f is the computed stress and &beta; is the compressive stress reduction factor which depends on the normal tensile strain, &epsilon;<sub>n</sub>. The relation between &epsilon;<sub>n</sub> and &beta; (see the Biaxial Behavior Section ) is tri-linear. Default values result in &beta; = 1.

Uniaxial Behavior \u2003\u2003Figure 1 shows the compression and tension envelopes and the input parameters. The confined concrete envelope is defined by Equation 1 up to strain ecc . The default values of fcc and ecc are equal to fpc and ec0 , respectively, for an an unconfined behavior. Following this region, the compression envelope is tri-linear and passes through the points ( ecint , fcint ) and ( ecres , fcres ) in that order. For compression strains larger than ecres , the residual stress is fcres . \u2003\u2003For compression strain, the slope of the unloading branch is defined by Equation 2. After reaching zero stress, the material reloads linearly to the point with the largest tensile strain that occurred before. \u2003\u2003The tension envelope is linear until it reaches ft . If the tension stiffening parameter M is not specified, the tension envelope after reaching ft is tri-linear and passes through the points ( etint , ftint ) and ( etres , ftres ) in that order.

After reaching zero stress, the material targets the point (0, - alpha ft ). Thereafter, the material loads linearly to the point where the peak compressive strain previously occurred. In the case where the slope leading to this target point is less than that for the point (0, - alpha ft ), the material reloads directly to the point where peak compressive strain occurred. thumb|center|upright=4.0|alt=ConcretewBeta Figure 1 |Figure 1.
