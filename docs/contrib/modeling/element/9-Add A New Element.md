# Add A New Element

<p>The OpenSees applications allows developers to use their own element
modules to the application. Unlike most other programs, the elements are
added at run-time and not at compile time. The advantage of this is the
the developers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not need the OpenSees source files or libraries to compile and
link the application.</li>
<li>Can share their modules with others without having to provide the
source code.</li>
</ol>
<p>The element modules can be written using either C++, C, or Fortran.
Whatever the language the developer wishes to use, the element modules
make use of the <a href="OpenSees_API" title="wikilink">OpenSees API</a>
to for example find nodal coordinates and displacements, and make use of
material modules that exist in OpenSees or are also added as external
routines.</p>
